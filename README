A skeletal MSc Thesis Template for the Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh.

I used this combination of class and style files to build my Master's thesis for December 2012. The university's standards have no doubt changed since then; if you use this and update the class and style files please update them and send a pull request (see below). 

Please be prepared -- no matter you much you tweak these files you will very likely need to fix a few things manually before you reach the end and your thesis is accepted.

Finally, these files are the culmination of work done by prior MSc and PhD students who used latex and shared their work with others. I am grateful to these people; I have thanked them personally and acknowledge them here.

Change Procedure:
* Fork repo
* Create 'template' branch
* Use 'master' and other branches for whatever you wish, such as your thesis.
* If you find a need to modify the class and style files, or add some...
  * Update 'template' to latest of this repo
  * Commit changes to 'template'
  * Merge 'template' to your working branch
  * Send pull request on 'template' to this repo, so that others may benefit from your insights!
